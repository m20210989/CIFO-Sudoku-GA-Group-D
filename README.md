# CIFO-Sudoku-GA-Group-D
The aim of this project is to implement Genetic Algorithms (GAs), applied to a Sudoku problem in order to obtain the best solution. To do so, we have designed a fitness function and other appropriate genetic operators to reach an optimal solution (e.g. crossover, mutation and selection).
